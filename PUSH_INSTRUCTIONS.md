## 📤 How to Push to GitHub

### Method 1: Direct Push (On Your Orion HPC)

```bash
cd RComPlEx-NF

# View the commit to verify
git log -1 --oneline

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

If you get authentication errors, see Method 2 below.

---

### Method 2: Set Up GitHub Authentication (If Needed)

#### Option A: Using Personal Access Token (Recommended)
```bash
# Generate a token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Permissions needed: repo (full control)

# Configure git to use the token
git remote set-url origin https://<YOUR_TOKEN>@github.com/paliocha/RComPlEx-NF.git

# Push
git push origin main
```

#### Option B: Using SSH Key
```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  # Copy this

# Update remote to use SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:paliocha/RComPlEx-NF.git

# Push
git push origin main
```

---

### Method 3: Create a Patch File (If Push Fails)

If you can't push directly, you can create a patch file:

```bash
cd RComPlEx-NF

# Create patch file
git format-patch -1 HEAD --stdout > optimization_patch.patch

# Copy to your local machine and apply there
# On your local machine:
git apply optimization_patch.patch
git push origin main
```

---

## 🔍 Verify the Commit

Before pushing, verify everything is included:

```bash
# View files changed
git show --stat

# View full diff
git show

# Check all changes are staged
git status
# Should show: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
```

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" error
This means GitHub authentication isn't set up. Use Method 2 above.

### "Repository not found" error
Check your remote URL:
```bash
git remote -v
# Should show: https://github.com/paliocha/RComPlEx-NF.git
```

### "Divergent branches" error
Someone else pushed changes. Merge first:
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
```

---

## 📋 What Happens After Push?

Once you successfully push:
1. ✅ Changes will be visible on GitHub
2. ✅ Anyone can pull the optimizations
3. ✅ You can deploy immediately on Orion
4. ✅ Test with: `nextflow run main.nf -profile slurm --tissues root --test_mode true -resume`

---

## 🎯 Quick Start After Push

```bash
# On Orion HPC, pull the changes
cd /path/to/RComPlEx-NF
git pull origin main

# Verify the optimizations
cat QUICK_COMPARISON.md

# Run test mode (15-30 minutes)
nextflow run main.nf -profile slurm --tissues root --test_mode true -resume

# Monitor
watch -n 10 'squeue -u $USER'
tail -f .nextflow.log
```

---

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter issues pushing:
1. Check GitHub authentication: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication
2. Verify repository permissions (you should have write access)
3. Contact your IT team if firewall blocks GitHub

**The optimizations are safely committed locally - they won't be lost!**
